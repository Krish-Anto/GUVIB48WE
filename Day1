1. Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. In contrast, HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

“A JavaScript object is a collection of named, values having state and behavior (properties and method)”. For example: Person, car, pen, bike, Personal Computer , Washing Machine etc. Take the case of cars. All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car.
